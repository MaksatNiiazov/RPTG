# Visual Redesign

The entire stylesheet collection was refreshed with a dark fantasy theme. Colors and fonts are driven by CSS variables so the style can be tweaked easily. Inline styles in templates were also updated to keep the new look.

## Changes
- Unified "dark velvet" color palette
- Reworked layout styles across all pages
- New Google font imports: **Beleren** and **Cormorant Garamond**
- Updated inline styles in map and HP controls
- Buttons and cards feature gold and burgundy highlights
- Inventory rows still flash when changed
- Added `fog-in` animation utility

## Functional Checklist
- [ ] Login and registration pages
- [ ] Character inventory operations (equip, unequip, drop)
- [ ] Navigation links and back button
- [ ] Rulebook, items and magic sections
- [ ] Map token controls
