# Visual Redesign

The entire stylesheet collection was rewritten with a dark theme. Every page now uses shared CSS variables for colors and modernized layouts. Inline styles were updated to match the new palette.

## Changes
- Unified dark color scheme with CSS variables
- Reworked layout styles across all pages
- Updated inline styles in map and HP controls
- Buttons and cards feature accent highlights
- Inventory rows still flash when changed

## Functional Checklist
- [ ] Login and registration pages
- [ ] Character inventory operations (equip, unequip, drop)
- [ ] Navigation links and back button
- [ ] Rulebook, items and magic sections
