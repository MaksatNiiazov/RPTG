# Visual Redesign

The styles have been reworked again with a clean light theme. Fonts now use **Roboto** and **Merriweather** and a sidebar navigation was introduced. All colors come from CSS variables for easy tweaks.

## Changes
- Soft blue color scheme with neutral backgrounds
- Sidebar navigation layout
- Google font imports updated to **Roboto** and **Merriweather**
- Updated inline styles in map and HP controls
- Inventory rows still flash when changed
- Added `fog-in` animation utility

## Functional Checklist
- [ ] Login and registration pages
- [ ] Character inventory operations (equip, unequip, drop)
- [ ] Navigation links and back button
- [ ] Rulebook, items and magic sections
- [ ] Map token controls
