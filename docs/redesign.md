# Visual Redesign

The styles have been reworked again with a clean light theme. Fonts now use **Roboto** and **Merriweather** and a sidebar navigation was introduced. All colors come from CSS variables for easy tweaks.

## Changes
- Soft blue color scheme with neutral backgrounds
- Sidebar navigation layout
- Google font imports updated to **Roboto** and **Merriweather**
- Updated inline styles in map and HP controls
- Inventory rows still flash when changed
- Added `fog-in` animation utility
=======
The entire stylesheet collection was rewritten with a dark theme. Every page now uses shared CSS variables for colors and modernized layouts. Inline styles were updated to match the new palette.

## Changes
- Unified dark color scheme with CSS variables
- Reworked layout styles across all pages
- Updated inline styles in map and HP controls
- Buttons and cards feature accent highlights
- Inventory rows still flash when changed

- [ ] Login and registration pages

- [ ] Navigation links and back button
- [ ] Rulebook, items and magic sections
